# ML-DL-Journey: From Web Developer to ML/DL Engineer

Welcome to my journey to becoming a Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) engineer with a strong Computer Science (CS) foundation! This repository tracks my progress as I transition from web development (Python, JavaScript, some C++) to a full-fledged ML/DL engineer. The roadmap below outlines my learning plan, with checkboxes to mark completed topics and a flexible 18–24-month timeline (10–20 hours/week). Each phase links to dedicated repositories for code, projects, and notes.
